									<h2>What's Wispar?</h2>
									<p>A free, open-source, self-hostable, digital book management solution; Wispar aims to replicate
										features of
										restrictive commercial eBook and Audiobook management suites,
										like those offered by Amazon, Google, Apple etc. The core innovative feature of Wispar is a synced
										audio-to-text
										reading experience similar to the one provided by
										Audible/Kindle Whispersync, without being limited to books purchased from Amazon, devices supported
										by Amazon,
										or requiring their monthly
										subscription The simple and intuitive web interface is accesible in most modern browsers and
										combines playback
										progress across audio/ebooks into a single Library item.
										It also provides some automatic metadata correction or augmentation from online APIs, as well as an
										interface
										for users to manually manage book metadata.</p>
